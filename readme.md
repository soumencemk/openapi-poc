# OPEN API SPECS

The OpenAPI Specification is a community-driven open specification within the OpenAPI Initiative, a Linux Foundation
Collaborative Project.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs,
which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access
to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a
consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to
what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in
calling a service.
